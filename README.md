# FlowChemistry Instruction
Welcome to Flow Chemistry. This is an AR application built on HoloLens2 to project holograms in a laboratory environment. The application will walk you through the assembly steps of the flow chemistry.

## Overview
In the application, you will be able to see 3 large panels. The left one is the menu panel, where you can change settings. The Step by Step animation will be played in front of the middle panel. And the text instruction will be displayed on the right panel.

## Step by Step Animation
Most of the interactions in this application can be achieved by voice command. You can say “next” to go through the Step-by-Step assembly instruction, and the command “back” to go back to the previous step.
